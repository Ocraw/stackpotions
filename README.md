Stackable potions for Mineclonia (temp)
===================================

What is this?
---------------
A WIP mod for stackable potions.  
It will be refined once the "mechanics" are in place and working well.  
The name might change at that point, or anything else for that matter.

Settings
---------------
The only setting is how many potions you can stack.  
Can be changed in Settings menu.  

Known Issues
---------------
At the moment, it is not possible to swap potions directly, you must  
take out the potion and then put a new one.  

License
---------------
Mineclonia licenses apply, as I just changed a couple functions.
